All the low count spectra are in the HS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

NOTE: For nH, I don't fix it for all epochs, as it may change. And fixing it seemed to give issues for some of the SS epochs.

# After running the light curve routine, the code outputs (in spectral_results.txt) which observations are upper limits (as defined by the swifttools.ukssdc pipeline).
# These should not be fitted, so are input to the spectral fitting function (steps 4 and 6).
# The code also outputs the count rate, used when converting count rate to flux (step 7).
# Note that the upper limits from the pipeline are at the 3-Ïƒ level, calculated using the Bayesian method (see Kraft, Burrows & Nousek, 1991, ApJ, 374, 344).
